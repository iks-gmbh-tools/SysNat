# SysNat

***This software development tool is made for***
- translating natural language in programm code (with a minimum of developer effort)
- executing the system requirements as automated tests (by any team member also in a purely non-technical role)
- generating system description documenation

***Applying *SysNat* consequently is supposed to have the following effects in the long run:***

a) Exectuable Examples become the Single Point of Truth (no or no unknown deviation between the application itself, its programm code and its description).

b) There is always a current system documentation (it can be generated within seconds).

c) Non-technical team members are able to modify existing Executable Examples, to create new ones and to execute them on their own without technical support (because the natural language used is intuitively understandable).

All this is done in natural language and can thus be used by business experts, requirement engineers, developers, testers as well as operators. That is why *SysNat* supports ATDD, BDD, DDD, DevOps and cross functional teams.

Technical Requirements:

- Java 8 \*
- Eclipse or IntelliJ \*
- Junit 4
- Selenium 

\* These two requirements are not part of this repository and must be provided by you. 

_SysNat_ is optimized for the use under *Windows*. There is no known reason why _SysNat_ should not work under other operation systems but it is currently not yet tested.
